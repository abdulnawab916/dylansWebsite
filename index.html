      Congrats on graduating! I am very proud of you. I know we don't talk super often but just remember you can always reach out to me if you ever need anything. I noticed a couple of times you complimenting me on my 'Panda Dunks'. And I knew that you were never really into shoes/fashion like that. My idea was to get you a pair. I hope you enjoy the gift. Oh! And I remember you mentioned you like when people talk or present their passions. So here is mine, a little website I made for you, with your own custom domain that you get to keep! I know you like handwritten letters, but this is something that is still tangible, and you will be able to keep as well (just digitally) I will be making updates to this every year for your bday as I get better at producing sites. Love you man.
      You are the funniest guy that I know, and I already know you will accomplish a lot in life. Just make sure to stay postiive, and open to new things. Sometimes what you are looking for is right in front of you.
      <br></br>
      
      [Henry, Nathan, and Emily helped contribute to getting you the Pandas. :)]
